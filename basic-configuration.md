# Basic Configuration

This guide will cover everything you need to do to get started with the basics of what the FSS Bot offers.

- **Prefix**

By default, the FSS Discord Bot responds to ``/`` slash commands.

- **Channels**

Log Channel: ``/set_modlog_channel <#channel>`` sets the channel where the FSS Bot will log things such as message deletions, warnings, and a lot more!
